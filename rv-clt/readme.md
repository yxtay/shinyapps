This Shiny app serves to demonstrate the Central Limit Theorem.

It has also been an exercise for me to gain better understanding in developing a Shiny app. Specifically, a dynamic UI is required due to probability distribution requiring different number of parameters. The resulting varying number of inputs also mean I have to find a solution to feed different number of arguments to the sample generating function in a straightforward manner.

A good understanding of the reactive function is also necessary to save computation time and ensure that a consistent sample is used for a number of different plots.

It has been a useful learning experience for me. I hope you benefit from it as much as I did. For any query or suggestion for code improvement, please contact me on Github.
